# Understanding Transformers Encoders

This code is designed to provide a deep understanding of the inner workings of Transformers Encoders, particularly focusing on the self-attention mechanism. Transformers are a crucial part of natural language processing models and are widely used in various applications, including text generation, language translation, and more.

## Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism is a key component of Transformers. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when making predictions. In this code, we delve into the details of self-attention and visualize its functioning.

To run this code and visualize self-attention:

1. Install the required packages using pip:

```
!pip install transformers
!pip install bertviz
```

2. Import the necessary modules for visualization and analysis of the self-attention mechanism.

3. Load a pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer, and specify a text input for visualization.

4. Visualize self-attention using the "bertviz" package. You can choose the layer and head for visualization.

5. Understand the concept of scaled dot-product attention, multi-headed attention, and its role in processing input data.

6. Observe how the self-attention mechanism works by visualizing the attention scores between words in the input sequence.

## Feed-Forward Layer

In addition to self-attention, Transformers use a feed-forward layer to process and transform the input data. The code demonstrates the implementation of the feed-forward layer and its role in the Transformer model.

## Layer Normalization

Layer normalization is essential for stabilizing and normalizing the input data before passing it through the self-attention mechanism and feed-forward layers. This code shows how layer normalization is applied within a TransformerEncoderLayer.

## Positional Embeddings

Positional embeddings are used to provide information about the position of words in the input sequence. This code explains how positional embeddings are created and combined with token embeddings to provide the Transformer model with positional information.

## Full Transformer Encoder

Finally, the code assembles all the components into a full Transformer Encoder. This step-by-step explanation helps you understand how a Transformer Encoder processes input data, including token embeddings, positional embeddings, self-attention, feed-forward layers, and layer normalization.

By running this code and following the provided explanations, you can gain a deeper insight into the functioning of Transformers Encoders and their significance in natural language processing tasks.

Feel free to experiment with different input sequences, layers, and heads to visualize and analyze self-attention in Transformers further.
